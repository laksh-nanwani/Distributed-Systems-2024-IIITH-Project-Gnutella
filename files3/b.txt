Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks represent a significant shift from traditional client-server models by enabling decentralized communication and resource sharing among nodes (peers). In a P2P network, nodes collaborate directly to distribute workload, store data, and facilitate efficient communication without relying on a central server. Such networks are highly resilient, scalable, and capable of operating even under partial network failures.
This project aims to replicate the core functionalities of the Gnutella protocol, a pioneering decentralized file-sharing system, by implementing mechanisms for node discovery, connectivity maintenance, communication, and file transfer. The Gnutella protocol is renowned for its robustness and decentralised architecture, which ensures that no single point of failure can disrupt the network.
